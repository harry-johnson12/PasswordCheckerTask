## PassPy
A lightweight Python application that checks password strength by analysing length, complexity, common patterns, and breach exposure.

PassPy was created by Harry Johnson for his second Y11 Software engineering task and was released on the 18/6/2025


## Features

- Testing vulnerability to brute-force attacks and password breaches 

- Testing common vulnerabilities in complexity and length.

- Providing an estimate on how long it would take a GPU accelerated brute force attack to crack the password.

- Generating random passwords that meets best-practice security standards.

## Dependancies
I have included a requirements.txt for your convinence
- Custom Tkinter
- Requests
- Pyperclip
